Understanding Digital Evidence in Cybersecurity

In an era of complex cybercrime, grasping digital evidence is essential for cybersecurity specialists, especially regarding malicious software behavior. Key elements include Link Files, Jump Lists, Thumbcache, Amcache, Recycle Bin, and Prefetch Files. These artifacts help trace suspicious activities carried out by attackers, providing insights into the programs used and any deleted files that may contain harmful content. By analyzing this evidence, investigators can reconstruct attack timelines and uncover execution methods, enhancing efforts to combat malware.


**Link Files:**
Documenting user activity is vital in forensic methodology. When a user opens a file or directory via File Explorer, special files known as link files are created in the user profile at:
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent.
Forensic investigators must analyze these link files to determine which files were accessed. Typically, link files are generated only for files opened by File Explorer or compatible applications, and they all have a .lnk extension.
To Analyze Link File Use Windows File Explorer:
Which  is a vital tool in the Windows operating system, used for accessing and managing files and folders. In the context of digital forensic investigations, documenting user activity is essential, as it can provide information about how the user interacts with the system.


**Jump Lists:**
Automatically generated by Windows, Jump Lists allow users to quickly access frequently or recently used items Figure 1. When a file is opened through an application, a special file is created in the user profile's Recent directory, found at:
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestination.

The **Structured Storage Viewer** is used to handle Jump Lists, which are part of the structured storage system in Windows. Jump Lists are created automatically by the operating system to provide quick access to frequently or recently used items.


**Thumbcache:**
Thumbcache stores thumbnail images of files for display in Windows Explorer, allowing users to see small images representing file contents.


**Amcache:**
The Amcache.hve file is a registry file containing information about executed applications and connected devices, such as storage devices and printers. It helps identify running programs relevant to an investigation and detect malware. Key data includes timestamps for first and last modifications, execution paths, and deletion times.


**Recycle Bin:**
Data in the Recycle Bin, including "$R" and "$I" files, are valuable for uncovering attacker behavior. When a file is deleted, two new files are created: the "$R" file contains the actual contents, while the "$I" file holds the metadata. This data allows investigators to track deleted activities and recover important information, helping reconstruct events and identify patterns that indicate attempts to hide evidence.


**Prefetch:**
Prefetch files are crucial evidence for forensic investigators analyzing executed applications. When an application is launched from a specific location for the first time, Windows creates a Prefetch file to speed up future loading, providing important data about the user's application history. These files can indicate whether a suspect used a program to conceal illegal activity, and even if deleted, may still exist as proof of execution. They play a significant role in malware investigations by identifying when malicious programs were run and uncovering other harmful files, assisting in determining the root cause of incidents.
